## Project Description

This app allows you to enter a VIN number and lookup the vehicle's information using the NHTSA's vPIC API.

It is built with Vue 3 using TypeScript, Pinia, Vuetify and Vitest.

Although a big fan of SASS. Decided to leverage Vuetify as much as possible and use their utility classes and helpers.
